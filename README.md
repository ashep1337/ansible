# ansible

This is where I have all my notes for Ansible.

I am also learning git.

all these .yml files are tutorial files for learning purpose and serve no real value. I will eventually move these files over to a seperate folder.

zsh.yml on the other hand is a working playbood that will auto configure zsh shell with auto suggestion and syntax highlighting. It will also add fzf configuration to the zsh shell plus a few other required packages.
