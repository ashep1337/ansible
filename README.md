# ansible

This is where I have all my notes for Ansible.

I am also learning git.

____________________________________________


local.yml is a Debian 12/13 configuration play that configures the theming, keybinds, and terminal to my current setup.

bootstrap.yml is to configure a new system to my ansible server.

most other files are for testing/learning and under development.
